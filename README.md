## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)

### What I learned

I learned how to style HTML form elements and radio buttons. The overlay effect of the number value was achieved with absolute / relative positioning. I also learned some basic HTML form validation and state change using JavaScript.

### Continued development

I would like more experience using JavaScript to manage input from HTML forms, and styling form elements on mobile.

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - I consult this site a lot while I'm still memorizing flexbox properties.
- [How to get value of selected radio button using JavaScript](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-get-value-of-selected-radio-button-using-javascript/) - This was a good starting point for me when I started writing script.js
